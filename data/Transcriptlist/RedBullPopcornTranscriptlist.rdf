But to be honest history is history and I still got some tricks up my sleeve and I'm completely ready to take on the French, the Russians, the Colombians whoever - bring on the competition. And we have got 6 really unique, cool spoots and it is gonna start with, right here behind me, La Rochelle very soon.</spoken_words>

Unfortunately due the severe nature of my injuries I being forced into retirement so the reason why I am here is I am an expert on Cliff Diving and I am gonna help to view a unique inside into this sport. From my perspective this location here in France, without a doubt, will be the most difficult tour stop. Why? Because it‘s really cold, we are talking 6 degrees, high winds, I feel sorry for the athletes, I really do. So I hope you are ready to see some of the bravest athletes on the planet.“</spoken_words>

	<spoken_words xmlns="http://localhost:8080/LMF/resource/">„This is a special event setup because we are dealing with a historical building and we had to create a special platform which has a big weight here on the bottom and the platform itself is not allowed to touch the building, so we have this weight counteracting the end of the platform. There is a lot of weight that comes on when the diver jumps off the platform creates about 3000-4000 pounds of pressure on the back here and it has to counterbalance which normally were connected to the building or the cliff or whatever we are at. But in this case we couldn‘t do that and they did a really good job making it as stable as possible. In addition we have one of the highest platforms or the highest platform of the tour, it‘s 27.5 meters and it‘s the first event. So for them it‘s quite a challenge, not only do they have to deal with the weather but also the scare factor that we have one of the highest platform, the water is only 12-14 degrees celsius, so it‘s a lot harder to land here and they are all pretty excited and a little bit scared.
Another interesting factor is the water colour. We have a greenish brown colour and it‘s not transparent as most of the other waters that we are in, which is in some ways good for the divers because they will see the surface directly. Sometimes when they have a transparent colour they look at the bottom and they don‘t really know where the surface is, that‘s why we have that water spray to break it up, in this case that helps them. On the other hand for safety purposes it‘s also a little bit more dangerous and when they land in the water you can not see more than one or two feet and so the scuba guys that are gonna help the divers and have to be on the top of their game in order to make sure they don‘t lose them in case something happens. We are dealing with extreme tide differences here at the atlantic coast, it‘s close to 6 meters difference from high to low tide but 20 feet and the minimum dive depth requirement for the divers is 5 meters and we have to reach this. In order to reach that we have to wait till it‘s high tide here, this high tide will still give us 27.5 meters which is the minimum we can actually get, otherwise it would be even higher.“ </spoken_words>

Mainly because of the fact that we don‘t have a place where we can train of 28 or 26 meters. So the whole idea is to keep your body in shape as much as you can and then up here is the thinking part of the rest of the dive. You do train but only on 10 meter and then the rest of it is up here.“</spoken_words>
